# Movement Unlocker

A Counter-Strike 2 Metamod plugin that removes the max speed limitation from players on the ground, feels like CS:S. Useful for zombie knockback, several movement gamemodes, or just easier bhop.

Ported from the [Movement Unlocker](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=255298) SourceMod plugin for CS:GO.

## Installation

- Install [Metamod](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=dev)
- Download the [latest release package](https://github.com/Source2ZE/MovementUnlocker/releases/latest) for your OS
- Extract the package contents into `game/csgo` on your server
